      <h2>Penpalling</h2>
      <p>
         One of the things I love writing letters to people living abroad, specially if it allows me to practise other languages!
          Currently I have a some Japanese and South Korean pen pals to whom I write in Japanese. Sometimes it takes long for me to decipher what they actually wrote to me (specially when it comes to characters), but it's a rewarding experience when I finally manage to understand and write an answer.
          From time to time we exchange stationery and little gifs from our countries.

      <h2>Reading novels</h2>
      <p>It has been 1 or 2 years since I became an avid reader. I especially like reading fiction, classics and Japanese literature.
          I recently discovered Goodreads SNS, where you can track how many books you read per year by setting reading goals and share and exchange opinions of the books you've read.

      <h2>Linguistic Immersion</h2>
      <p>
          Since languages are hard to mantain if you're not in touch with their speakers, I try to think of ways of creating a fake linguistic immersion environment so as not to lose fluency. 
          What I tend to do frequently is watching Japanese on-air TV channels (I actually pay for a suscription in a platform similar to Netflix) in the background while doing other stuff.
